            <h2>My Experience with Web Design and Development</h2>
            <p>I have taken a web design and development class before, 
                and although I didn’t pass, I gained valuable experience in the fundamentals of designing and building websites. During that time, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
                 Despite the setback, I realized that I have a knack for coding and design, and I’ve continued to practice and refine my skills independently. I’m confident that this time around, I can apply 
                 what I’ve learned and finally succeed in the course.</p>

            <h2>What I Hope to Learn from This Course</h2>
            <p>In this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of web design and development principles. I want to strengthen my skills in HTML, 
                CSS, and JavaScript, as well as explore modern tools, frameworks, and best practices for 
                creating responsive and user-friendly websites. Additionally, I am eager to learn about UX/UI design principles and gain experience in deploying websites. 
                My goal is to become more proficient and confident in building functional and visually appealing web applications.</p>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>With the web design and development skills I gain from this course, I hope to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. 
                I want to create websites and applications 
                that not only work efficiently but also offer an excellent user experience. In the future, 
                I’d love to work on developing innovative software solutions or even build my own web-based projects. 
                Passing this class will be a critical step in preparing me for a successful career in the tech industry.</p>
